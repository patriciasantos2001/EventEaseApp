Here's a brief summary of how Copilot assisted me throught the development:

Project Setup & Component Creation
- Helped me creating the Event Card component to diaply event details like name, date and location 
- Setting up basic routing between pages (event list and event details) using Blazor's Router and NavLink

Navigation & Layout
- Integrating navigation links using my preferred layout style with Bootstrap icons
- Ensure smooth page transitions and user-friendly navigation.

Two-Way Data Binding
- Implemented two-way data binding in an event editinf fotm using @bind
- Enabled dynamic preview of changes to event details in real time.

Bug Identificatio & Fixes
- Identified and fixed: missing input validation in EventCard; routing errors for invalid event IDs; performance bottlenecks in renderind large event lists.

Performance Optimization
- Provided me two solutions: pagination (load an event in chuncks with navigation buttons) and virtualization (efficiently render only visible items using <Virtualize> (i choose virtualization because its better for large datasets, reduced c)

Performance Measurement
- show me how to use: Browser DevTools for rendering and memory profiling; stopwatch in C# to measure load time; comparison techniques between pagination and virtualization
